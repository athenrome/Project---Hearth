  - "My first job was flipping burgers at a rundown diner. The pay was rubbish, but
    the company was great. People have a lot of stories, if you\u2019ll just listen
    sometimes"

    things... But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way"
  GhostStory1Text:
  - I grew up in a poor neighbourhood. Lots of drunks walking around, lots of homeless
    people. People trapped on the fringe of society. Makes me sick
  GhostStory2Text:
  - "This forest isn\u2019t like any other. I usually enjoy getting outdoors. But
    not here. Not in this forest. It's just not safe. "
  GhostStory3Text:
  - "Following your dreams can be tiring. Some days you just have to remind yourself
    that you love it and it\u2019s what you want to do. And some days you forget."
