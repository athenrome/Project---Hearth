  - "When you get to my age, most of your friends and family are gone. It isn\u2019t
    the end of the world, even if you\u2019re an old coot like me. The fire is nice,
    though. Nice and friendly."
  HopefulStorys2Text:
  - "Back in my day, a night like this would be spent with your mates and a cold beer.
    After a day of failed fishing\u2026 or was it hunting? This reminds me of those
    times."
  HopefulStorys3Text:
  - "I\u2019m no spring chicken, but as a young man I could carry three trees worth
    of wood  back to camp! Men these days don\u2019t have that kind of strength! But
    with hard work maybe they\u2019ll get there."
  GhostStory1Text:
  - "A Home is nice, but you\u2019re always reminded of how long you have left. You
    never know who or when another friend is gone. It\u2019s a lonely life, but we\u2019re
    all there together. "
  GhostStory2Text:
  - "When you get old, parts of you start fading away. It happened to the wife, and
    it\u2019s not what you want your family to see. At least out here they won\u2019t
    have to see me. "
  GhostStory3Text:
  - "Sometimes the darkness is comforting. But I know I still have some life left
    in me. I won\u2019t bow out just yet."
