  - "I\u2019ve had a lot of jobs, even though I\u2019m young. Something always went
    wrong, and I\u2019d have to leave. So I followed my dream of carpentry, and it\u2019s
    looking up."
  HopefulStorys2Text:
  - "Have you ever seen something or someone and go \u201CI want to be that.\u201D?
    I did. It\u2019s driven me time and time again to stay in the fight. I\u2019m
    not gunna let setbacks knock me down!"
  HopefulStorys3Text:
  - This fire is a lot like a person. Bright, ambitious, always reaching for the sky.
    Just needs a little help to get going.
  GhostStory1Text:
  - "I guess you can say I\u2019m unlucky. Wrong place, wrong time, and always stuck
    in the middle. Nothing always works the way I want it."
  GhostStory2Text:
  - "Being a carpenter, surrounded by all these trees, in the dark\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s
    all the ghosts of the tree\u2019s I\u2019ve carved in the past. It\u2019s silly,
    but still scary. "
  GhostStory3Text:
  - "When it gets dark, I see the things that I\u2019ve always messed up. It shakes
    me up inside. Can\u2019t let this fire die with that waiting for me in the dark."
  needWoodPromptsText:
  - Do you think we need some wood?
  - "Looks like we\u2019ll need wood soon."
  - Have we gotten wood recently?
  - Is the fire getting small, or is it just me?
  - "Not much fire left\u2026"

  lightDropPromptsText:
  - "This can\u2019t be good."
  - "I can\u2019t feel my toes\u2026"
  - Oh no, no, no, no!
  - "It\u2019s getting way too dark now\u2026"
  lightBoostPromptsText:
  - Yes, finally!
  - Ah, much better!
  - "Waaaaarm\u2026."
  - I wish it was always this warm.
  darknessPromptsText:
  - "Nope, don\u2019t like this."
  - "Light always goes out when you need it most\u2026"
  - "I\u2019m not afraid of the dark."
  - "If we stay around this fire, we\u2019ll be safe."
