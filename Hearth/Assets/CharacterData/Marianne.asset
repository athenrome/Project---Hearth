  - "I met this guy once. We were on a hill looking out on some cliffs. He\u2019d
    picked me a bunch of flowers. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him I hated
    flowers. Then I saw the stupid look on his face. Grinning ear to ear. Now I smile
    at the sight of flowers. "
  HopefulStorys2Text:
  - I never really had a home. I sailed around a lot, so there was always the boat.
    I used to drop anchor somewhere out from port and look at the city lights. The
    world has so much beauty in places no one thinks to look.

  - "I was alone a lot of the time. I never really had people hang around long enough.
    I used to wish there was. All I wanted was a friend. I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re
    all here"

  - "When my mother died, my father didn\u2019t take it too well. He was in hospital
    for a few days before he died. Then I was back on my own. "
  GhostStory2Text:
  - "I think there\u2019s something in the darkness. I couldn\u2019t see it, but I
    could feel it. It was cold."
  GhostStory3Text:
  - Without this fire. Without this warmth, this light, these people. It would just
    be more darkness...
