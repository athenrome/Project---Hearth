  - "Where I grew up, we didn\u2019t have much. We had our family and we had our home.
    We used to light fires like this to keep warm, and then huddle together and eat.
    It was simpler back then. Everyone was safe. Everyone was happy. No one ran away."
  HopefulStorys2Text:
  - "My father used to tell us about a place where the lights never go out. Where
    the fires burn forever and they never ever go out. People are okay there. They
    don\u2019t want to leave, and everyone helps each other."
  HopefulStorys3Text:
  - "I used to camp out in forests like this one. Not now obviously. There used to
    be lights in the sky at night. They\u2019ll be back again though. One day."
  GhostStory1Text:
  - "When I was younger, I used to watch the lights in the night sky. Then they went
    away, and I stopped looking up. I miss the night lights. I wish they\u2019d come
    back."
  GhostStory2Text:
  - 'I saw something out in the dark. It was moving too quick to catch what it was.
    But I know it was there. '
  GhostStory3Text:
  - I wish things would go back to how they were. There was light, it was safe. Everyone
    was together. It was fine. We were happy.
